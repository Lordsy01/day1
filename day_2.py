# **Title: Working Document – Reverse a 32-bit Signed Integer**

# ---

# ### 1. Problem Overview

# **Objective:**\
# Given a 32-bit signed integer, your goal is to reverse its digits. The challenge includes:

# - Handling negative numbers.
# - Managing trailing zeros.
# - Preventing integer overflow (i.e., making sure the result stays within the 32-bit signed integer range of -2³¹ to 2³¹ - 1).

# **Important Note:**\
# If the reversed integer overflows (exceeds the 32-bit signed integer limits), the final answer should be `0`.

# ---

# ### 2. Considerations and Edge Cases

# - **Negative Numbers:**\
#   The sign (`-`) should be preserved. For example, the reverse of `-123` should be `-321`.

# - **Trailing Zeros:**\
#   When reversing numbers like `1200`, the result should remove the leading zeros in the reversed number. (e.g., `1200` becomes `21` because `0021` is not a valid integer representation.)

# - **Integer Overflow:**\
#   The reversed number must be checked against the limits of a 32-bit signed integer:

#   - Minimum: `-2³¹` (i.e., `-2147483648`)
#   - Maximum: `2³¹ - 1` (i.e., `2147483647`)\
#     If the reversed number is outside this range, the output should be `0`.

# ---

# ### 3. Approaches to Solve the Problem

# #### A. Using String Manipulation

# 1. **Convert to a String:**\
#    Convert the given integer into its string representation. This makes it easier to reverse the digits.

# 2. **Handle the Negative Sign:**

#    - Check if the string representation starts with `'-'`.
#    - If it does, remove the `'-'`, reverse the rest of the digits, and then prepend the `'-'` back.

# 3. **Reverse the String:**\
#    Use Python’s string slicing to reverse the order of the digits.

# 4. **Convert Back to Integer:**\
#    After reversing, convert the string back into an integer.

# 5. **Check for Overflow:**\
#    Ensure that the integer is within the valid 32-bit signed range. If it is not, set your result to `0`.

# *Hint:* Think about the Python slicing syntax (`string[::-1]`) and how you might handle negative strings differently.

# ---

# #### B. Using Arithmetic Operations

# 1. **Determine the Sign:**\
#    Record whether the original number is negative, and work with the absolute value.

# 2. **Initialize a Result Variable:**\
#    Start with an empty result (for example, set it to `0`).

# 3. **Process Each Digit:**

#    - Use a loop to extract the last digit of the number using the modulo operation (e.g., `x % 10`).
#    - Append this digit to the result by multiplying the current result by `10` and adding the digit.
#    - Reduce the original number by removing the last digit (e.g., using integer division).

# 4. **Overflow Checking During Processing:**\
#    Before adding the new digit, determine if the current result (after multiplication) might cause an overflow. This may require a comparison with the maximum limit divided by `10`.

# 5. **Reapply the Original Sign:**\
#    After processing all digits, reapply the negative sign if the original number was negative.

# 6. **Final Overflow Check:**\
#    Make a final check to see if the number is within the valid range. If it’s not, the result should be `0`.

# *Hint:* Think of it like manually “building” the reversed number digit by digit. This method gives you more control over the process and helps understand overflow checks.

# ### 4. Step-by-Step Guidance (Without Full Code)

# 1. **Start by Understanding the Input/Output:**

#    - Input: An integer (which can be negative).
#    - Output: The reversed integer or `0` if overflow occurs.

# 2. **Plan Your Approach:**

#    - **For String Manipulation:**\
#      Outline the steps to convert, reverse, and convert back. Write pseudocode that might look like:

#      ```
#      Convert the integer to string.
#      If the string starts with '-', separate the '-' and the rest.
#      Reverse the digit portion.
#      Combine the '-' (if needed) with the reversed digits.
#      Convert the string back to an integer.
#      Check if the integer is within the 32-bit signed range.
#      Return the result or 0 if overflow.
#      ```

#    - **For Arithmetic Operations:**\
#      Create a plan that includes:

#      ```
#      Determine the sign and work with the absolute value.
#      Initialize result to 0.
#      While the number is not 0:
#          Extract the last digit.
#          Check if appending the digit would cause overflow.
#          Append the digit to the result.
#          Remove the last digit from the number.
#      Reapply the sign.
#      Verify the result is within range.
#      Return the result or 0 if overflow.
#      ```

# 3. **Handle Edge Cases:**

#    - **Negative Numbers:** Explain in your document how you plan to manage the negative sign.
#    - **Trailing Zeros:** Note that converting a reversed string back to an integer naturally removes any leading zeros.
#    - **Overflow:** Discuss why overflow is important (to avoid errors or unexpected behavior) and how to check for it.

# 4. **Testing Your Approach:**

#    - List some test cases such as:
#      - `-123` (should become `-321`)
#      - `1200` (should become `21`)
#      - `1534236469` (should return `0` due to overflow)
#    - Describe how you would use these test cases to verify each part of your solution.

# ### 5. Conclusion

# In this document, you have a roadmap for solving the reverse integer problem without the complete solution code. Use the steps, hints, and pseudocode provided to build your solution incrementally. Focus on:

# - Correctly processing the digits.
# - Handling special cases like negatives and zeros.
# - Checking for overflow conditions.

# By following these guidelines and understanding each step, you'll be well-prepared to write your own code solution in Python.
